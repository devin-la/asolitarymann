						Jeremy Mann's world is a place where pain, desire, and lust combine to project the realest parts of the human spirit. He embodies the grit and character of the urban landscape with a tone and color quality rivaled by few. Supported by a massive global following, his approach is a combination of menacing attack, fused with bolero romanticism.
						<br><br>
						Los Angeles based French director Loic Zimmermann combines a strong cinematic aesthetic with a cinéma vérité approach to capture the visceral parts of Mann, while humanizing the experience in an effort to bring the viewer behind the paint.
						<br><br>
						"A Solitary Mann" is a triumphant ode to a man who no doubt, will continue to leave his mark on the art world for years to come.

						Jeremy Mann (b. 1979) graduated from Ohio University with a Cum Laude degree in Fine Art-Painting. Afterward, he ventured out to California where he earned his Master's Degree with Valedictorian honors at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. Since then, Mann has garnered substantial attention in the art world. Praised by critics and collectors alike, his work recently graced the cover of American Art Collector magazine.
						<br><br>
						Executed on medium to large-scale panels, each exciting work demonstrates the artist's unmistakable style. Working on wood panels provides a strong support, where Mann can utilize a number of techniques: staining the surface, wiping away paint with solvents, and applying broad, gritty marks with an ink brayer. Mann paints with confidence and flair. He addresses complex compositions with a mature eye and his colors are both vivid and atmospheric.
						<br><br>
						Living in downtown San Francisco, Mann paints his immediate surroundings with intimate, dynamic expression. A number of unique compositions are inspired from the city's pavement, where reflected street lamps and neon signs glitter in the rain. In each work, Mann imbues the city with drama, mood, and personality..
						<br><br>
						Ever ambitious, Mann covers a wide range of subjects beyond cityscapes: interior scenes of lone, young women as striking and restless as the city itself; a bold and intriguing self-portrait, masterful still life paintings, and pastoral scenes that recall the landscape of his hometown.
						<br><br>
						Mann's remarkable skill and range have made him an integral part of the gallery's strong stable of artists. His skill is unusually strong for a painter so young.

						Loic Zimmermann is a French film-maker and visual-artist based in Los Angeles, developing works that encompass illustrations, photography, and films. 
						<br><br>
						His book, "e338, the Art of Loic Zimmermann" was published in 2014, regrouping a decade of his personal and professional production.
						<br><br>
						Zimmermann moved to California in 2008 to work as a concept-artist for visual effects, contributing to many Marvel blockbusters (Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America, and many more ) along with films that resonated deep in him such as Prisoners (Denis Villeneuve), True Grit and Serious Man (Coen brothers).
						<br><br>
						Over the past few years, his work gradually shifted from illustration and 3D to photography and film making.
						In directing his own projects, Zimmermann finds a medium that allows for collaborative work while giving him a wide range of tools to experiment with - his experience as a photographer and as an illustrator have a direct impact on his cinematography and his understanding and practice of the digital tools allow him to tackle any subject. His main inspiration leans toward independent cinema (with a real love for the 70’s).
						<br><br>
						With a few music videos behind him (including the 15 min long Time Washes Everything Away for Dirty Beaches), and documentaries (Gamma Wray, A Solitary Mann) freshly wrapped up, Loic Zimmermann is already in pre-production with a few new projects.
